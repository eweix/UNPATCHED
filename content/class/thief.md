## Class Feature (pick 1)

**Always Prepared.**
When in town, you may spend any amount of money to buy an Unlabeled Package. When the package is unwrapped, you declare what it contains, as long as the contents comprise the appropriate number of slots, doesn't cost more than you originally paid, and are available in the town you bought the Unlabeled Package. You can even put multiple items inside a large Unlabled Package (including smaller Unlabeled Packages). This is basically retroactive shopping. You can have no more than two Unlabeld Packages at a time.

**Lucky.**
Once per day, you can reroll a die.
Any die.
You can pass this ability to an ally so long as you could plausibly have helped them.

**Thieves' Knacks.**
You know a few uncanny tricks.
You may *move silently*, making no noise at all, so long as you move very slowly.
You may *climb walls* as smooth as butter.
You may *open locks*, even unconventional ones, with some time and concentration.

**Opportunist.**
Whenever you get a situational advantage for attacking or causing harm (element of surprise, elevated terrain, etc.), you deal an addition +d6 damage.

**Great Escape.**
Once per day, you can escape from something that is restraining you that you could plausibly escape from.
