# Character Creation

## 0. Goals
1. (Have the option to) roll randomly to generate a character as much as possible.
2. Do it as fast as possible and start playing!
3. Over time, characters increase greatly in options, not power.

## 1.1 Generating a Character
The bare minimum:
1. Paper + pencil + 2d6.
2. Roll 2d6 each for STR, DEX, CHA. STR is power and toughness, DEX is quickness and precision, and CHA is charm/luck. 
3. Characters start with d6 Hit Protection (HP)
4. Roll for a starting [Template](/docs/templates)

## 1.2 Advancement
- Templates. Characters gain a new template after each session (up to 4 maximum), or may replace a template.
- 

## 1.3 Other stuff is optional
- Roll on trinket tables (p. 160 of D&D 5e player's handbook, many cool ones available online)
- Personality and backgrounds - if you want to use these, it's fine
- Feats - well, special abilities are always neat

## 2. Advancement and Experience
