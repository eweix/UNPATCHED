# Core Mechanics

## 1. Click clack shiny math rocks
When it comes down to it, few things beat rolling against a target.

When you try to do something, take a d20 and try to roll equal to or less than the appropriate stat. So if you're trying to lift up a gate, then roll against STR. If you're trying to steal someone's book while they're not looking, roll against DEX. You get the idea.

Sometimes this doesn't work. In that case, the GM can set a target to roll under based on how likely the outcome is and what else is going on.

### 1.1 (Dis)Advantages
If there's something that makes an outcome more or less likely, roll twice and take the better or worse result.
