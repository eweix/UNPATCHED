# Templates (or, learning on the job)
Ripped directly from delightful [GLOG](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html), Templates represent both the progress and abilities of a a character.
Each one gives some special ability, opening up new and interesting ways of complicating your problems.

The three classic template sets are [wizard](/docs/templates/wizard/), [thief](/docs/templates/thief), and [fighter](/docs/templates/fighter).
Others will be added, but these are here to start.

Typically a character can have up to 4 templates.
These can be mixed and matched between different classes/kits/collections.
Alphabetical templates (A,B,C,D) must always be acquired in order.
Special templates, marked using ∆, Ω, and other greek letters, can be acquired at any time and reflect an achievement or other circumstantial boon.
