# Special Templates
Special templates can be gained at any time if certain conditions are met. These conditions are known to the GM and the GM alone, unless they choose to share.

## Warlock Ω
Seek out those that lurk tangentially to your own world.
Should you survive an audience with Their terrible presence, you shall be named Their Emissary.

Upon completing the pact, a Warlock is granted power equivalent to a template.
Perhaps they earn part of a class, or they gain some random ability from something else.
It doesn't matter how or what, but the Warlock gets some sort of signing bonus for their servitude.

<!-- ## Lamarckian Ω -->
<!-- What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. -->
<!-- And also vulnerable to future trauma. -->
<!-- Both can be true. -->

<!-- ## Chimera Ω -->
<!-- A being fueled by monsterhearts. -->
