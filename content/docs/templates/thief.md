## Thief A
**Thievery.**

**Unlabeled Package**
When in town, you may spend any amount of money to buy an Unlabeled Package.

You can even put multiple items inside a large Unlabled Package (including smaller Unlabeled Packages). This is basically retroactive shopping.

Any die.

You get an additional use of your lucky ability.
You can use your lucky ability on an ally so long as you could plausibly have helped them.

**Great Escape**
Once per day, you can escape from something that is restraining you that you could plausibly escape from.
