# 1. The Dice
**When you try to do something, roll d20.**
**You succeed if you roll equal to or less than the appropriate stat.**
**This is called a SAVE.**
So if you're trying to lift up a gate, then SAVE vs. STR.
If you're trying to steal someone's book while they're not looking, SAVE vs. DEX.
You get the idea.

Sometimes this doesn't work.
In that case, the GM can set a target to roll under based on how likely the outcome is and what else is going on.

**Many things can be resolved without the dice.**
If there is no pressing penalty for failure or if there is an abundance of time, simply move ahead and figure out what makes sense without the dice.
Once the dice are on the table, they are the final arbiters.

**Example: Sneaking into the library**

Cole (2 HP, 5 STR, 10 DEX, 4 CHA) wants to sneak into the College of Memory to gather materials for a research project.
The GM tells him to SAVE vs. DEX, since Cole wants to avoid the notice of the many-eyed Librarians.
Cole rolls a 13, higher than his DEX of 10.

The GM tells Cole that he hears a "shhh" behind him and gets a gentle tap on the shoulderâ€¦

### 1.1 Critical Success and Failure
A 1 is always a critical success - a spectacularly favorable result.
A 20 is always a critical failure - a spectacularly horrible result.
If you're not playing these for entertainment value, I don't know what you're doing.

### 1.2 (Dis)Advantages
If there's something that makes an outcome more or less likely, roll twice and take the better or worse result.

### 1.3 Contested Rolling
If people players come into conflict and are fighting over something, just have them both roll and see who gets the lower number.
Or play rock-paper-scissors.

### 1.4 Conflict
In fights, still roll against relevant stats when trying to do things.
Physical damage is dealt first to HP, and then to STR.
Other kinds of damage might harm other stats.
If a stat reaches zero, you die.

HP recovers after a quick breather, stats require extended rest and care.
