# Character Creation

## 0. Goals
1. (Have the option to) roll randomly to generate a character as much as possible.
2. Do it as fast as possible and start playing!
3. Over time, characters increase greatly in options, not power.

## 1. Generating a Character
### The bare minimum
1. Paper + pencil + 2d6.
2. Roll 2d6 each for STR, DEX, CHA. STR is power and toughness, DEX is quickness and precision, and CHA is charm/luck. 
3. Characters start with d6 Hit Protection (HP)
4. Choose a starting [template](/templates)

### Other stuff is optional
- Roll on trinket tables (p. 160 of D&D 5e player's handbook)
  - See also the [chaosgen 5e trinket generator](https://www.chaosgen.com/dnd5e/trinket)
- Personality
- Any backstory whatsoever

## 2. Advancement and Experience
- [Templates](/templates). Characters gain a new template after each session (up to 4 maximum), or may replace a template.
- Treasure. Whether it's gold, relics, or pretty paintings, loot is a means of progression.
- Stories. Write down a single notable thing about your character from each session. Slowly accumulate a whole picture of who they are through their actions.
