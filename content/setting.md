# Chicago II
Chicago was destroyed in the 80s. God is dead. The U.S. still has privatized healthcare. There's like eighteen different kinds of magic and all of them are dangerous. But everything's going surprisingly wellâ€”at least we prevented the rapture!

Chicago II isn't quite like Old Chicago, but it it smells the same. Home to everything from angels to demons to that one weird talking cat. Also humans. Still has the best deep-dish pizza for thousands of miles.
