# Chicago II
![Chicago_2.png](Chicago_2.png)

Chicago was destroyed in the 80s. God is dead. The U.S. still has privatized healthcare. There's like eighteen different kinds of magic and all of them are dangerous. But everything's going surprisingly wellâ€”at least we prevented the rapture!

Chicago II isn't quite like Old Chicago, but it it smells the same. Home to everything from angels to demons to that one weird talking cat. Also humans. Still has the best deep-dish pizza for thousands of miles.

Between mishandled relief efforts, opportunists, and the lack of regulation around magic, the rebuilding project became a power struggle. Chicago is controlled today by a few major factions:
- The Cult of Hope. Those who yet bend to the will of God. Friendly with fugitive Angels. They search for a means to bring about the resurrection of their deity. Has a distinct mystic bent.
- The Camarata. Collectors, information brokers, and occasional mercenaries. Sometimes organized crime, but with more government ties. The closest that the government has come to effectively regulating magic.
- The Visible Court. Wields most of the obvious political and legal power in Chicago. Their fingers are deep in the city and state government. They do not get along with the Camarata.
- There are also assorted smaller groups with their own goals. Covens, organized crime, people trying to keep their small businesses open. That sorta thing.
