# 1. Dice
## 1.1 When to Roll
**Many things can be resolved without the dice.**
If there is no pressing penalty for failure or if there is an abundance of time, simply move ahead and figure out what makes sense without the dice.
Once the dice are on the table, they are the final arbiters.

## 1.2 Unopposed Rolls
- Roll one d6 per skill level of the appropriate skill.
- Discard all dice showing 4-6. 
- Use this 1-2-3 scale based on the result of the roll.
	- 0: Failure
	- 1: You scrape through. The bare minimum of what could be considered a success while making a real mess of it. 
	- 2: Success with a minor setback or complication. 
	- 3: A clear success.

**Example: Sneaking into the Archives**

Cole wants to sneak into the College of Memory to gather materials for a research project.
He decides to rely on his *I am definitely not suspicious* (3) skill, since Cole wants to avoid the notice of the many-eyed Librarians.

Since his skill is at level 3, Cole rolls 3 dice: 4, 6, 1.
Discarding the 4 and 6 leaves Cole with 1 as his highest die—a pyrrhic victory of sorts.
The GM rules that Cole finds a book he needs, but as soon as he goes to grab it he gets a gentle tap on the shoulder…

## 1.3 Opposed Rolls

**Example: Push the Button**

Alice wants to push the button that ends the world. Dave doesn't want the world to end. Naturally, this places them at odds with one another.

Alice decides to reach for the button, relying on her *unstable telekinesis* (4), and Dave tries to oppose her using his *explosive speed* (4). Both make their rolls:

Alice: 4, 2, 3, 5

Dave: 6, 6, 1, 3

Alice discards the 4 and 5, leaving her with a total of 2 + 3 = 5. Dave discards his two 6s, leaving him with a total of 1 + 3 = 4. Since Alice beats Dave, she slaps her hand down on the button and the world ends.

# 2. Character Creation

## 2.1 Goals
1. (Have the option to) roll randomly to generate a character as much as possible.
2. Do it as fast as possible and start playing!
3. Over time, characters increase greatly in options, not power.

## 2.2 Generating a Character
### The bare minimum
1. Paper + pencil + d6s
2. Characters start with 2d6 + 6 HP.
3. Choose a starting [class](/class).

### Spicing things up
1. Go through each advanced skill on your character sheet and rewrite it for flavor.
	- e.g. *strength* to *display of strength* or *mournful strength*
	- e.g. *mathmology* to *brain-melting topology* or *non-euclidean geometry*
	- Also note that spells are just really specific skills too.
2. Note down gear, don't worry too much about the specifics. Everything you write in gear should be a significant 
item. Don't worry too much about proper mechanics or anything.

### Other stuff is optional
- Roll on trinket tables (p. 160 of D&D 5e player's handbook)
  - See also the [chaosgen 5e trinket generator](https://www.chaosgen.com/dnd5e/trinket)
- Personality
- Any backstory whatsoever

## 2.3 Advancement
- You get 1 EXP for each of the following:
	- Surviving the session
	- Solving a problem or puzzle creatively
	- Saving the day
	- Rolling all 6s (no matter the outcome)
	- Excellent roleplaying (fun is better)
- To advance a skill, roll as if making an opposed roll.
	- If the total is equal to or less than character's EXP:
		- gain +1 to that skill
		- spend EXP equal to the total of the roll
	- Otherwise, spend 1 EXP.
	- Each attempt at advancement requires a training montage of some sort.

**Example: Spell Research**

Lemsli just returned to town and wants to improve her *Disastrous Explosion* (4) spell. Lemsli currently has 8 EXP, 
so her total for the roll needs to be 10 or less to succeed. Lemsli rolls a 4, 3, 1, 6, discards the 4 and 6, and 
ends with a total of 3 + 1 = 4. Lemsli ranks up *Disastrous Explosion* from 4 to 5, and deducts 4 EXP from her 
total. She still has 4 EXP left. After spending a week in town studying at the Library of Babel, she feels 
readier than ever to cause problems.
