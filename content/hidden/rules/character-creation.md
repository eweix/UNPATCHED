# Character Creation

## 0. Goals
1. (Have the option to) roll randomly to generate a character as much as possible.
2. Do it as fast as possible and start playing!
3. Over time, characters increase greatly in options, not power.

## 1. Generating a Character
### The bare minimum
1. Paper + pencil + d6s
2. Characters start with 2d6 + 6 HP.
3. Choose a starting [class](/class).

### Spicing things up
1. Go through each advanced skill on your character sheet and rewrite it for flavor.
	- e.g. *strength* to *display of strength* or *mournful strength*
	- e.g. *mathmology* to *brain-melting topology* or *non-euclidean geometry*
	- Also note that spells are just really specific skills too.
2. Note down gear, don't worry too much about the specifics. Everything you write in gear should be a significant item. Don't worry too much about proper mechanics or anything.

### Other stuff is optional
- Roll on trinket tables (p. 160 of D&D 5e player's handbook)
  - See also the [chaosgen 5e trinket generator](https://www.chaosgen.com/dnd5e/trinket)
- Personality
- Any backstory whatsoever

## 2. Advancement
