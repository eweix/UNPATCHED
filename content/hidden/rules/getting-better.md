# Advancement
- You get 1 EXP for each of the following:
	- Surviving the session
	- Solving a problem or puzzle creatively
	- Saving the day
	- Rolling all 6s (no matter the outcome)
	- Excellent roleplaying (fun is better)
- To advance a skill, roll as if making an opposed roll.
	- If the total is equal to or less than character's EXP:
		- gain +1 to that skill
		- spend EXP equal to the total of the roll
	- Otherwise, spend 1 EXP.
	- Each attempt at advancement requires a training montage of some sort.

**Example: Spell Research**

Lemsli just returned to town and wants to improve her *Disastrous Explosion* (4) spell. Lemsli currently has 8 EXP, so her total for the roll needs to be 10 or less to succeed. Lemsli rolls a 4, 3, 1, 6, discards the 4 and 6, and ends with a total of 3 + 1 = 4. Lemsli ranks up *Disastrous Explosion* from 4 to 5, and deducts 4 EXP from her total. She still has 4 EXP left. After spending a week in town studying at the Library of Babel, she feels readier than ever to cause problems.
