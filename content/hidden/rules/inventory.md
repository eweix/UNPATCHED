# 2. Items & Inventory
Toys are fun to play with.
Everyone should have some.

Generally: if it's on your character sheet, it's fair game (for use, for destruction, etc.).
If it isn't written down, it's assumed that it's not really significant.

## 2.1 Encumbrance

**Characters get ten slots of things, or one sack**[^1].
A slot isâ€¦ "slot-sized".
It can hold a significant item.
Anything you really care enough to track is significant.

Players can carry a second set of ten items, but they will be encumbered.
Typically all of an adventurer's professional gear fits in 10 slots.

Items should be tracked in an [anti-hammerspace](https://rottenpulp.blogspot.com/2012/06/matt-rundles-anti-hammerspace-item.html).
It need not be rigorous; just note where/how things are carried.
It makes things more fun.

### 2.1.1 Bulky
Very large items are *bulky*.
A character may not comfortably carry more than one of these at a time.

### 2.1.2 The weight of life
Everything takes up space in the inventory:
- Rare books found in the musty library
- Armor worn for protection
- Spells ensnared in the mind-palace

### 2.1.3 Bundles
Sometimes it's not worth it to track every single thing that one might have a use for.
Write it down as a sort of "kit" that contains the usual tools of the trade.
In this case, only the group of items is significant enough to track.

## 2.2 Usage Dice
Instead of tracking individual units of something, use [usage dice](https://the-black-hack.jehaisleprintemps.net/english/#usage-die).
**Usage dice (UD) are used to track consumable items.**
**Each time the item is used, roll the die.**
On a 1-2, the die size decreases down the chain:

**d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4 > all gone**

- d8 - very abundant resource. Irreplaceable ancient magic or the like.
- d6 - normal resource. Food, water, torches.
- d4 - scarce resource. Magic painkillers, for example.

**Example: Torches Flicker**

The party is exploring a deep dungeon.
They are afraid of the dark and decide to light the way using torches (d6).
At the end of the first hour, the party rolls the usage die (a d6) for the torches, and get a 5.
The torches are still burning bright.

At the end of the second hour, the party rolls the UD for the torches again and get a 2.
The UD for the torches decreases from d6 to d4.
The torches flicker a little bit, but they don't go out just yet.

## 2.3 Breaking Things
Things get damaged on the first pass, and broken on the second.
That which damages a regular shield may not be sufficient to damage a magical one.
