# Class: Angel

> *"Even before mortals broke past the boundary and spread across the Spheres, they knew us. We were made evident through the immutable natural law. We are in the flow of electrons and the [final stellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_stellation_of_the_icosahedron) of the ideal shapes. We are truth and order."*

## Skills
- mathmology
- second sight
- (spell) alter topology
## Gear
- A charm in the shape of a platonic solid.

## Special: Alter Topology
The caster reshapes a thing into another topologically equivalent form (i.e. a coffee mug into a donut shape). Mass-energy conservation must be obeyed. Sentient, living, or inherently magical things try to resist this.
