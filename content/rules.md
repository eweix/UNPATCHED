## Play
Players describe what their characters do. The GM advises when their action is impossible, demands a cost or extra steps, or presents a risk. Players can revise plans before committing so as to change goal/stakes. 

With time, gear, and skill, you can overcome almost any obstacle. If you lack one of these elements, then use the dice. Roll when failure is meaningful.

## Rolling
Roll a skill die — d6 by default, higher with a relevant skill, or d4 if hindered by injury or circumstances. If helped by circumstances, roll an extra d6; if helped by an ally, they roll their skill die and share the risk. Take the highest die.
- 1–2 Disaster. Suffer the full risk. GM decides if you succeed at all. If risking death, you die.
- 3–4 Setback. A lesser consequence or partial success. If risking death, you’re injured.
- 5+ Success. The higher the roll, the better.

If success can’t get you what you want (you make the shot, but it’s bulletproof!), you’ll at least get useful info or set up an advantage.

Directly engaging with danger may risk *death*. Mitigate risks with more modest goals or better tactics. If something cannot be overcome in a single roll, establish player's actions and risks, roll, and see what changes. Lather, rinse, repeat.

## Other Things to Know
### Load
Carry as much as makes sense, but more than one bulky item may hinder you at times. Record significant items using silly drawings on index cards.

### Advancement
After a job, each character increases a skill (none → d8 → d10 → d12) and gains d6 cash (₡).

### Defense
Say how one of your items breaks to turn a hit into a brief hindrance. Broken gear is useless until repaired.

### Harm
Injuries take time and/or medical attention to heal. If killed, make a new character to introduce ASAP. Favor inclusion over realism.
