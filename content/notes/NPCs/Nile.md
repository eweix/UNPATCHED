**Fixation**: Obsessed with expanding the Guild until it controls [[Chicago II]].

**Motive**: Wants to prove his competition (the other heads of office) wrong. Nile may be insane, but nobody says that he's bad at his job!

**Attitude toward PCs**: Condescending, frustrated, since they work for him but aren't always great at their job. He's like a manager.

Quotes:
- Did I ask?
- How unfortunate
