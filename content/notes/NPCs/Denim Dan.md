**Fixation**: Obsessed with finding the Eye of Helios, a scrying implement that can see whatever the sunlight touches.

**Motive**: clearing his name with the [[Camarata]], who think that he took the crystal ball. There's also a bounty out on his head.

**Attitude toward PCs**: *Amused* that they either aren't afraid of the [[Camarata]] or that they presume to interfere with his quest.
