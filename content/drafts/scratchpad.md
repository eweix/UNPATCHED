Heaven's throne sits empty.
The gate to Hell lies open in California.
But you still have to pay rent.
Life goes on in Chicago II.

## On NPC design
[Zelda-style NPC personalities](https://todistantlands.github.io/2023/06/13/zelda-npcs.html)
- They have something they are very interested in.
- They have something that is of interest or value to you.
- They are not interested in you or your goals.

## Hammerspace
Does everyone have one these days? Minor magic built on storing things. Weight-limited, not space limited.

## Golden weapons
Made from the body of God. Grants *bloodshed* (d12). You hear a voice in your head. When you indulge in violence, you have a chance of *blacking out* (1-2) or *momentarily losing control* (3-4).

If you die with it in hand, the weapon devours your soul.

There are 22 golden weapons in total, each corresponding to one of the major arcana.

## Chicago II
Built after old Chicago was destroyed in the 80s. Mostly like old Chicago, except that reality is a little bit more frayed around the edges. Still has pretty good hotdogs and deep-dish pizza.

## Gloamings
A splash of monochrome in an otherwise colorful world. A crack in a pristine building. A whisper in the wind. An incongruity in the world, something that should not be.
