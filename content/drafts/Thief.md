title: Sneak
---
You're adept at skullduggery. Light-fingered, so to speak. A downright scoundrel. Look, you're sneaky, okay? Start with *Climbing* (d8), *Stealth* (d8). Take 1 feat, dark clothing, a knife, and â‚¡1.
- *Backstabbing*: Silently incapacitate a foe while unseen. If risk is unavoidable, roll an extra d12.
- *Blending In*: Be unseen in crowds, darkness, and bad weather.
- *Intrusion*: When bypassing locks or traps, treat *disasters* as *setbacks*, and *setbacks* as *success*.
- *Jack of All Trades*: Roll at least a d8 for all mundane tasks outside of combat. This does not cover situations requiring specialized training.
- *Light Fingers*: Pickpocket or palm small objects in plain view, no roll needed.
- *PARKOUR!*: Falls that hurt others only slow you down. Recover instantly when knocked down.
