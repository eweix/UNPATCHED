# 3. Hazards
There's a lot of dangerous things out there in the world.
It's probably better to avoid them as much as possible, instead of trying to take everything head on.

## 3.1 Damage and Recovery
Physical damage is dealt first to HP, and then to STR.
Other kinds of damage might harm other stats.
If a stat reaches zero, you die.

HP recovers after a quick breather, stats require extended rest and care.
Characters can take a quick rest at any time, which restores HP (reroll the HP die).
**If characters lack an important resource (light, water/food, sleep), then they cannot benefit from rest until that need is met.**

## 3.2 Combat
**In fights, players use SAVES when trying to do things.**
Attacking would be STR, trying to avoid damage might be DEX, trash-talking your adversary might be CHA.
Some things might not require a SAVE at all.
Some circumstances might put you at advantage or disadvantage.

**Attacks typically do d6 damage**, but different implements can change that.
Note the damage die of a weapon or other item next to it.

**Armor reduces damage taken.**
Most armor reduces damage taken by 1 point, though some heavier armor might reduce it by 2 or even 3 points.

**Example: Gigantic ants**

Tove (3 HP, 6 STR, 9 DEX, 7 CHA) made some bad decisions and is facing off with a gigantic ant.
They decide to attack it with their very large stick (d4).
Tove has to SAVE vs. STR to damage the ant.
Fortunately, Tove rolls a 3, and manages to hit the ant for 2 damage.

This does not do much except make the ant angry.

On its turn, the ant attacks Tove and deals 4 damage.
Tove only has 3 HP, so this drops them to zero HP.
The additional point of damage goes to Tove's STR, reducing it from 9 to 8.
If only Tove could afford armorâ€¦
