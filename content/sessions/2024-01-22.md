## Situation Report
Dorian, Albertus Magnus & Stewie, Mara, and R4T-5 were sent by Mythos to recover an artifact thought to be linked to the death of God. Their search led them to a tomb hidden within the Gloaming—the darkening pit beneath the Submetro of Chicago 3. After a quick round of introductions, the five ventured into the tomb.

The tomb had four rooms arrayed in a hallway. At the end of the hallway lay a large stone door, barred with an iron slab. The entire tomb was illuminated by flickering incandescent lightbulbs.

The crew found a collection of statues buried in coffins within the first four rooms: two filled with snake sculptures, one holding a sculpture of an angel, and one empty. R4T-5 and Dorian noticed that the flickering lightbulbs in the tomb spelled out a message in morse code:

> BY HIS LIGHT WE WORKED
>
> AND IN HIS IMAGE MADE
> 
> GOLDEN HANDS. TWELVE PAIR.
> 
> TOOLS OF THE BLEAKEST TRADE.

Dorian also chose this time to fiddle with his meta-sunglasses, which showed him what lay behind the fourth wall. He struck up a conversation with me, tried to weasel out some information, and succeeded in making himself look crazy in front of the crew. He ended up passing his sunglasses around to everyone else so that they wouldn't think he was crazy.

Later, the party broke open the statue of the angel and took the silver ring from its finger. The broken statue let out a cloud of poison, which caught Dorian and R4T-5. After treating Dorian, R4T-5 put on the ring and realized that it allowed someone to sense movement—even through walls—at the price of their sight.

Seeing the loot and the trap, Mara and Albertus threw some stuff at the snake sculptures to break them open at a distance, avoiding the poison. There, they found a golden amulet and a earring of sight. Combinations of the amulet, earring, and silver ring didn't have a noticeable effect.

It was at this time that R4T-5 put on the glasses again offered me an exchange. A question for a question; an answer for an answer. I gave a question, received an answer, and then R4T-5 took off the glasses and announced they had a single question held in reserve. If this game had an inspiration mechanic, I would have awarded inspiration then—both in and out of character, I had been played.

Then Dorian put on the silver ring and looked at the barred door. He saw weird motion on the other side—rippling, alien. He announced this, and the party formulated a plan to take on whatever lay behind the doorway. With everyone in position, R4T-5 pushed up the bar and backed away.

A strange creature—a facsimile of a person—stepped out. The group dubbed this an "angel." When it tried to escape the tomb, they subdued it rather handily and watched it dissipate into nothingness.

In the room beyond, there lay a pair of golden gauntlets, marked with the number XI. R4T-5 mentioned a piece of verse burned into their mind when they saw the gauntlets ("Feast upon the flesh of fallen angels") and told everyone to beware the gauntlets and to not touch them together. The party decided to separate the gauntlets and have Albertus carry one while R4T-5 carried the other. They then left the tomb to report back to Mythos.
