## Ryan's Report
Dorian tried forming a magical emotional bond with a random old guy, who ran away screaming “I need an adult”. Afterwards the group from session #1 reported back with their findings from the tomb, two golden gauntlets that formed one of the God Hands. Dorian attempted to lash to Mythos, but failed. Mythos introduced a new player to try to increase group cohesion, named Ryan, who had been found sneaking around the base and eventually caught. Ryan did not increase group cohesion, which reached an all-time low throughout the session due to multiple disputes. Mara is sure he knew Ryan before, and that they met at a bar at one point.

Lowell was fascinated by the gauntlets, and wanted to research using them as part of his weapons facility. The party received 6 ca\$h each (which Ryan stole from R4T-5) and were given time off as a break. During this time, Dorian re-explored the tomb, R4T-5 helped with Lowell’s projects (which earned it an additional 6 ca\$h), Albertus Magnus bought Stewie an entire wheel of gourmet cheeses, and Mara looked into getting a gun that could fire explosive bullets. Dorian also worked with weapons, but was frustrated that a six-shooter could only shoot six bullets, so he demanded that the interns make him a six-shooter that could shoot more often without reloading. 

Dorian wanted to wear the gauntlets and see what would happen, and Lowell was happy to oblige, as long as he stayed within a hermetically sealed chamber with a camera on him at all times, and didn’t wear both gauntlets at once. Due to a previous dispute in which Ryan made Dorian appear to piss himself, Dorian said he would only wear the gauntlet if Ryan also did in a separate chamber. Ryan attempted to run away, but was not able to, and the gauntlet experiment began for both participants.

Once the light turned green, both Dorian and Ryan donned their gauntlets. They were assaulted by voices in their head, but both of them held up to it very well. Still, Dorian eventually lost his mind, and he took off the gauntlet and sat in the corner, where he remained for several minutes contemplating what he had seen and experienced while with the gauntlet on.

In Ryan’s room, he was able to establish control over the gauntlet, with difficulty. He then did an unknown amount of stimulants and began punching the walls of the chamber with his gauntletless hand. After he had destroyed much of the wall, he passed out. His body, which remained under control of the gauntlet, broke out of the containment room. He was eventually stopped by Mara, who had a gun with tranquilizer darts, and R4T5 came out to pry the gauntlet off Ryan’s hand.

In the hospital, Ryan was treated for signs of overdose (he is very small). Dorian dealt with a clear personal crisis, and later attempted to lash to Ryan, but the emotions were too intense for him to really understand what was going on. Since the group was in the hospital anyway, Dorian persuaded Albertus Magnus to get Stewie checked out due to his intense diet. The doctor reported that the rat was abnormally healthy, and for some reason was literally made out of pure muscle.
