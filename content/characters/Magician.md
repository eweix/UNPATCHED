# Magician
Magic-users, psychics, vegans, and warlocks. You've got some source of power and a means to channel it. Choose one skill at (d8). Take *Spellbinding* feat, a magical implement, and a suitable costume.

## Feats
- *Spellbinding*: Take 2 spells at (d8) or 1 at (d10). Cast at risk of unnatural side effects (1-2) or friendly fire (3-4).
- *Alchemy*: Bind a spell you know into a single-use concoction. Costs â‚¡1 in materials, but anyone can use it.
- *Dispel*: Remove or cancel a magical effect. Risks deadly or painful backlash.
- *Rote Memorization*: Choose one spell you know. You may cast it without risk of backlash, lasting as long as you concentrate. Casting in battle still risks harm. Still roll when casting the spell.
- *Wizard Vision*: You can "see" and identify magic. This is not great for your sanity.
