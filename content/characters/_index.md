## Character Creation
Choose a specialty and an origin. Or talk to the GM about making one up.
<!-- Characters start with 6ish skill increases and/or credits’ in items, possibly combining “specialty” and “origin” (or “3 skill increases” as a stand-in). -->
Come up with a name. Then…

### 1. Choose a Specialization
Choose a Specialization. Take the skills, feats, and gear listed.

{{< section-list summary >}}

### 2. Create an Origin
Either increase two skills (d6 → d8 → d10 → d12) *or* gain two characteristics marking your origin.
- Bestial: Attack with fang or claw.
- Collectivist: Grant 2 dice when helping.
- Dark-dwelling: Sense perfectly in darkness.
- Eidetic: Notice tiny details and recall them with perfect clarity.
- Fast: If there's a question of who acts first, it's probably you.
- Hard-boiled: Absolute dogged determination. Helps in searching for information, but hinders in polite society. Take a trench coat and detective hat.
- Magical: Take 1 spell. Cast without risk of side effects, lasting while you concentrate.
- Mechanical: No need for food or air. Must be repaired, not healed. Limbs break as defense.
- Relentless: Injuries don't hinder in battle. Until you keel over from blood loss.
- Small: Helps evade, hide, and seem harmless. Not compatible with Large.
- Striking: Awe-inspiring presence, helps in most social situations.
- Large: Helps lift, block, and intimidate. Not compatible with Small.
- Thick-skinned: While your guard is up, deflect attacks from all but heavy weapons & magic.

### 3. Finishing Touches
Take a phone and ₡2. Most items and upgrades cost ₡1 each. Ignore negligible transactions like a knife or a meal.

Draw a doodle of your character. **This is not optional.**

## Feats
- *One More*: When you incapacitate a foe up close, strike another in reach just as hard.
- *Endurance*: Carry two *bulky* items comfortably.
- *Martial Arts*: Follow any 3+ hand-to-hand roll with a grab, disarm, throw, trip, or the like.
- *Overwatch*: When you or an ally roll 1-4 in combat, you can take all the consequences alone.
- *Second Wind*: Ignore all *hindrances* until you catch your breath. Sleep to use this again.
- *Spellbinding*: Take 2 spells at (d8) or 1 at (d10). Cast at risk of unnatural side effects (1-2) or 
friendly fire (3-4).
- *Alchemy*: Bind a spell you know into a single-use concoction. Costs ₡1 in materials, but anyone can use 
it.
- *Dispel*: Remove or cancel a magical effect. Risks deadly or painful backlash.
- *Rote Memorization*: Choose one spell you know. You may cast it without risk of backlash, lasting as 
long as you concentrate. Casting in battle still risks harm. Still roll when casting the spell.
- *Wizard Vision*: You can "see" and identify magic. This is not great for your sanity.
- *Backstabbing*: Silently incapacitate a foe while unseen. If risk is unavoidable, roll an extra d12.
- *Blending In*: Be unseen in crowds, darkness, and bad weather.
- *Intrusion*: When bypassing locks or traps, treat *disasters* as *setbacks*, and *setbacks* as *success*.
- *Jack of All Trades*: Roll at least a d8 for all mundane tasks outside of combat. This does not cover 
situations requiring specialized training.
- *Light Fingers*: Pickpocket or palm small objects in plain view, no roll needed.
- *PARKOUR!*: Falls that hurt others only slow you down. Recover instantly when knocked down.

## Gear
If an item costs less than a new video game system, the only cost is the time it takes to get it. You can purchase things that are plausible. If it stretches plausibility, you may have to do some negotiating or search further afield.
