# Fighter
Exactly what it says on the tin. You're good at fighting. Choose a *Weapon* (d8), *Strength* (d8), 1 feat, and some plain clothing.

## Feats
- *One More*: When you incapacitate a foe up close, strike another in reach just as hard.
- *Endurance*: Carry two *bulky* items comfortably.
- *Martial Arts*: Follow any 3+ hand-to-hand roll with a grab, disarm, throw, trip, or the like.
- *Overwatch*: When you or an ally roll 1-4 in combat, you can take all the consequences alone.
- *Second Wind*: Ignore all *hindrances* until you catch your breath. Sleep to use this again.
