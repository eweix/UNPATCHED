## Character Creation
Choose a specialty and an origin. Or talk to the GM about making one up.
<!-- Characters start with 6ish skill increases and/or credits’ in items, possibly combining “specialty” and “origin” (or “3 skill increases” as a stand-in). -->
Come up with a name. Then…

### 1. Choose a Specialization
Choose a Specialization. Take the skills and gear listed.
- Face: Skilled in Reading People (d8), Deception (d8). Take an extensive disguise wardrobe.
- Muscle: Skilled in Intimidation (d8) and either Hand-to-hand (d8) or Shooting (d8). Take a sword, firearm, or cyber-arm.
- Sneak: Skilled in Climbing (d8), Stealth (d8). Take climbing gear and night vision goggles.
- Medic: Skilled in Medicine (d8), Electronics (d8). Take a medical kit and surgery tools (bulky).
- Tech: Skilled in Hacking (d8), Electronics (d8). Take repair tools and a custom computer (bulky).

### 2. Create an Origin
Either increase two skills (d6 → d8 → d10 → d12) *or* gain two characteristics marking your origin.
- Bestial: Attack with fang or claw.
- Collectivist: Grant 2 dice when helping.
- Dark-dwelling: Sense perfectly in darkness.
- Eidetic: Notice tiny details and recall them with perfect clarity.
- Fast: If there's a question of who acts first, it's probably you.
- Hard-boiled: Absolute dogged determination. Helps in searching for information, but hinders in polite society. Take a trench coat and detective hat.
- Magical: Take 1 incantation. Cast without risk of side effects, lasting while you concentrate.
- Mechanical: No need for food or air. Must be repaired, not healed. Limbs break as defense.
- Relentless: Injuries don't hinder in battle. Until you keel over from blood loss.
- Small: Helps evade, hide, and seem harmless. Not compatible with Large.
- Striking: Awe-inspiring presence, helps in most social situations.
- Large: Helps lift, block, and intimidate. Not compatible with Small.
- Thick-skinned: While your guard is up, deflect attacks from all but heavy weapons & magic.

### 3. Finishing Touches
Take a phone and ₡2. Most items and upgrades cost ₡1 each. Ignore negligible transactions like a knife or a meal.

Draw a doodle of your character. **This is not optional.**

## Skills
Choose or invent skills as needed. This list is far from exhaustive.

Climbing, Connections, Deception, Electronics, Engines, Explosives, Hacking, Hand-to-hand, Intimidation, Labor, Persuasion, Piloting, Running, Shooting, Stealth, Tracking

<!-- Characters who start with broader skills should start with fewer skills, or with less useful skills. -->

## Gear
If an item costs less than a new video game system, the only cost is the time it takes to get it. You can purchase things that are plausible. If it stretches plausibility, you may have to do some negotiating or search further afield.
