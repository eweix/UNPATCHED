# Welcome
This is the home page for UNPATCHED, a tabletop game I'm throwing together on the fly. It is in perpetual revisions, living only long enough to be something fun to do with friends.

UNPATCHED draws on the [Gremlin Game Designer's Creed](https://www.tumblr.com/indierpgnewsletter/726538296789991424/okay-im-going-to-think-outloud-about-this) ([also explained in The Indie RPG Newsletter](https://ttrpg.substack.com/p/159-gremlin-creed)), which calls for things to be fun and weird above all else. Inspirations include: [BASTIONLAND](https://www.bastionland.com/), [MOTHERSHIP](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/mothership), [The Ultraviolet Grasslands and SEACAT](https://www.exaltedfuneral.com/products/uvg-2e?_pos=5&_sid=e3c61a4e7&_ss=r), [The GLOG](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html) and all of its flavors, and [grimDARK](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/319340/grimDARK-So-Basic-A-Nobleman-Can-Do-It-Edition). 

# Start Here
- A good place to start is by looking at the [core mechanics](/docs/core-mechanics). It'll get you all of the things you need to know. Not everything (never everything), since many things are best made up on the fly.
- Also check out [character creation](/docs/character-creation). Make up someone/something to play and go from there.
